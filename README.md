###### This is a rundown of things I've thought about and worked on in a time of self-reflection and career planning.

### Things I've Worked On:
Task | Description | Notes |
--- | --- | ---
Markdown | Write up work in markdown | Writing this whole thing in markdown should help me with writing better READme's in the future.
Free Code Camp | Start Free Code Camp | I feel that by filling in some holes in my understanding of Javascript in particular I'll be better able to problem solve. Even exercises in very simple procedures/concepts such as scope proved helpful.
Job Hunting | Searching for Jobs/Interesting Companies | I've reached out to several lower-level employees at a variety of companies, many in the vertical farming space. I've also reached out to (and gotten responses from) several potential internship companies that specialize in fields that can be carried over to the AgTech/VF space.
Tutorial Videos | D3 Tutorial Videos | Because so many of the AgTech Companies I've found emphasize D3, I watched several tutorials such as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jvoTV54nXw and the Accio Code series on D3 starting at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3FMuLT_3Ik


### Things I'd Like To Work On:
1. Javascript
 * Vanilla Javascript
 * AngularJS
 * EmberJS
 * D3
2. Python

### Personal Projects:
Project | Language | Description |
--- | --- | ---
Crop Dashboard | Javascript, Angular | For managing clients and their recurring orders.
Environmental Controls Automation | Python | For taking input metrics like humidity, temp, etc and using that to dictate some output using a raspberry pi, such as run the dehumidifier, or turn off the heater, or increase airflow, etc.
Crop Success App | Javascript, D3 | For ongoing research with respect to AB testing of crops and environmental controls. App would deliver information regarding the success or failure of test conditions in an easily digestible, visual manner.


### Things I've Thought About:


### User Stories for Crop Dashboard App:
###### I started working on this app but realized I really wasn't sure how a lot of it was going to work. Do I need to make two exports classes for Client and Crop? Should I just make crops an added property of clients? Vice versa? Ultimately I ended up scrapping it as it was essential a follow-along of the online-store model we've been doing and worked on some user-stories to help me understand where I should go with this.

* As an admin, I'd like to be able to add, edit, and remove clients.

* As an admin, I'd like to be able to input the type and number of crops ordered by a client, recurring delivery dates, etc

* As an admin, I'd like to be able to add, edit, and remove crops.

* As an admin I'd like to be able to specify the properties of a crop: days required undercover after seeding, days needed under light, ideal moisture levels in substrate, where it is on the production floor (ie. which level on which rack), etc.

* As an employee/user I'd like to be able to see a dashboard of everything that's been seeded, where it's at in the production process, where I might find it on the production floor.

* As an employee/user I'd like to see a harvest schedule, letting me know what should be harvested/prepped, when, and how (ie. live-product delivery or cut/packaged product).

* As an employee/user I'd like to be able to see a seeding schedule--pulling from the recurring orders from clients--letting me know what I should seed and when. What today's seeding needs are. How much I need to seed, and which client I'm seeding for. etc.
